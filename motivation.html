<p>I am passionate about studying and research. However, my supervisor always assigned me so much administrative work (It's all his own non-research and non-school related work, with even his family work included) that I did not have enough time to spend on my studies, which was not in line with my original intention of pursuing a PhD. My main motivation for deciding to drop out is to pursue higher level academic challenges and opportunities. I was eager to improve my research skills in a new environment rather than doing sundry work for my supervisor that has nothing to do with my research (minimal pay and no potential for growth). I value the opportunity for personal growth and development and I’m undaunted by the challenges of the academic path. I am confident in my ability to overcome the challenges and to achieve more and build good relationships with new advisor and fellow students.</p>
<p>After two years of graduate studies (even though my time hasn't been entirely dedicated to research, it's evident that I've gained significant experience), I've come to realize that the essence of academic research lies in the exploration of knowledge, in-depth investigation, and the practical application of innovation. However, in the current environment, I have encountered certain limitations. My supervisor is not actively engaged in academic research but focuses more on non-academic tasks. Doctoral training seems to prioritize the accumulation of time rather than academic contributions. Graduation depends on seniority rather than academic achievements, and the thesis defense process appears more like a routine formality, with most reviewers having personal connections with my supervisor. He rarely offers specific academic guidance, making it difficult for me to access constructive academic mentorship.</p>
<p>I am eagerly yearning for a more academically challenging environment where research takes precedence over secondary tasks. I believe that in such an environment, I will have the opportunity to fully develop my research skills, employ innovative research methods, and build valuable relationships with like-minded mentors and peers. I aspire to integrate my research skills with practical application, and I firmly believe that experimentation, simulation, and ultimate implementation are crucial theoretical methods for generating high-quality and highly cited papers. I look forward to pursuing knowledge, creating meaningful research, and actively participating in the international academic community to drive progress in the field.</p>
<p>Overall, I am completely awared that my current supervisor seldom conceptualize ideas in research articles and lacks focus on specific research topics, which means I cannot get positive academic guidance from him. I feel that in such an environment, it will be more difficult to acquire the knowledge I seek and work toward my goal. Consequently, I have grown increasingly eager to find a research environment that aligns better with my personal aspirations. Therefore, I am considering leaving my current position.</p>
<p><a href="Letter of Recognition.pdf">Here</a> is a letter of recommendation he had previously written for me, which attests to the fact that even though I was under his tutelage I still worked very hard and diligently. After consulting with my potential mentor, I will submit my resignation to him. I hope that potential mentors will not try to contact him before that, as he will definitely prevent me from leaving my current position.</p>
