<p>I am passionate about studying and research. However, my previous supervisor always assigned me so much administrative work (It's all his own non-research and non-school related work, with even his family work included) that I did not have enough time to spend on my studies, which was not in line with my original intention of pursuing a PhD. I was eager to improve my research skills in a new environment rather than doing sundry work for my previous supervisor that has nothing to do with my research (minimal pay and no potential for growth). I value the opportunity for personal growth and development and I’m undaunted by the challenges of the academic path. I am confident in my ability to overcome the challenges and to achieve more and build good relationships with new supervisor and fellow students.</p>
<p>After two years of graduate studies, I've come to realize that the essence of academic research lies in the exploration of knowledge, in-depth investigation, and the practical application of innovation. I am eagerly yearning for a more academically challenging environment where research takes precedence over secondary tasks. I believe that in such an environment, I will have the opportunity to fully develop my research skills, employ innovative research methods, and build valuable relationships with like-minded supervisor and peers. I aspire to integrate my research skills with practical application, and I firmly believe that experimentation, simulation, and ultimate implementation are crucial theoretical methods for generating high-quality and highly cited papers. I look forward to pursuing knowledge, creating meaningful research, and actively participating in the international academic community to drive progress in the field.</p>
<p>Overall, I am completely aware that my previous supervisor seldom conceptualizes ideas in research articles and lacks focus on specific research topics, which means I cannot get positive academic guidance from him. I feel that in such an environment, it will be more difficult to acquire the knowledge I seek and work toward my goal. Consequently, I have grown increasingly eager to find a research environment that aligns better with my personal aspirations. Therefore, I quit my previous lab.</p>
<p><a href="Letter of Recognition.pdf">Here</a> is a letter of recommendation my previous supervisor had previously written for me, which attests to the fact that even though I was under his tutelage, I still worked very hard and diligently. Despite the fact that my previous supervisor did not provide active academic guidance and often assigned me administrative tasks, I continued to work diligently and earned his recognition.</p>
